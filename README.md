# YAPG - YetAnotherPhotoGallery
Plain and easy gallery viewer. Galleries are folder-based (public/galleries) and
therefore no database is used. Hence, be aware who is getting a link to the 
gallery.

Since I wanted something easy and learn ruby, sinatra et.al. I decided
to implement this.

Twitters bootstrap is used as a front-framework and blueimp-gallery for 
the javascript slideshow view.

# Getting started
* Use helpder/create_gallery.rb to create a gallery.
* Gallery images and thumbnails are stored under public/galleries
